This is forked from Jack Moore's ColorRating code: https://github.com/jackmoore/colorrating
I added support for multiple tables in the SQLite database, allowing you to rate multiple elements
and display the highest (or lowest) rated elements from a table.

March 7, 2011 - Version 1.0, first release of ColorRating2
